# Assurance Report – Leantime (Track B)

## 1. Executive Summary
Provide a short overview of the tested scope, main findings, and overall risk posture.

## 2. System Under Test
- Name: Leantime (open-source project management web app)
- Deployment: Local Docker containers (app + MySQL/MariaDB)

## 3. Test Approach and Coverage
Summarize:
- Functional coverage (auth, RBAC, CRUD, search/filter/pagination).
- Non-functional coverage (performance, security, usability).
- Any limitations or exclusions.

## 4. Metrics
Include key metrics such as:
- Functional coverage (requirements vs tests).
- Defect counts and defect density.
- Performance metrics (p50/p95 latency, throughput, error %).
- Security findings by severity.

## 5. Findings and Analysis
Detail:
- Major functional defects.
- Security issues (with severity and potential impact).
- Performance bottlenecks and likely root causes.
- Usability and compatibility observations.

## 6. Risk Assessment
Classify risks by likelihood and impact.
Tie each risk back to the related requirement and evidence.

## 7. Recommendations
Provide prioritized recommendations:
- Quick wins.
- Medium-term improvements.
- Long-term architectural or process changes.

## 8. Conclusion
Summarize whether the SUT meets the defined quality gates and
any conditions required for accepting the current level of risk.
