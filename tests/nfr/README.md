# Non-Functional Tests (Other)

This folder contains non-functional tests that are not strictly performance or security.

Planned coverage:
- U1: Usability and accessibility of key flows.
- C1: Compatibility across browsers or viewport sizes (if selected).
- R1: Reliability/recovery tests (if selected).

Document how to run these tests and where to find evidence.
