# Performance Tests

This folder contains performance/load test scripts for Leantime.

Planned coverage:
- P1: Baseline performance profile (reads/writes/auth mix).
- P2: Stress test and breakpoint analysis.

Before running these tests:
- Ensure Leantime is running and seeded with a realistic number of tasks.
- Verify the base URL and credentials used by the scripts.
