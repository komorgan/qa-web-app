# Functional Tests

This folder contains functional tests for the Leantime application.

Planned coverage:
- F1: Authentication (login/logout)
- F2: Authorization (RBAC)
- F3: CRUD lifecycle on tasks
- F4: Validation and error handling
- F5: Search/filter and pagination

Each test file should:
- Reference the appropriate requirement ID (FR-x).
- Be runnable against a locally running Leantime instance.
